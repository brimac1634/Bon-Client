            Twice he chimes the spoon upon the coffee cup. He sips with his eyes
            closed, listening to his head beat with his heart. A heavy night; an
            early morning. Across from him, up against the workshop wall, is a
            desk lamp-lit with white light. The cloth, the patterns and his
            chalk awaits.

            One thing at a time, he was told, there is always a journey. A
            history. A tradition. And though one may feel these aspects of craft
            slipping away, there is always its life-line - a bright thread
            pathing between the trees - always within reach.

            Remembering once there was not a workshop but a apartment where his
            Master sat late in the evening with his sewing machine. He became
            familiar to the heavy chunking sounds and the quiet hisses of his
            mentor's frustration. The drift of pipe smoke. In the mornings, his
            Master would show what he had produced to the apprentices and would
            lead them though each intricate part of the garment at a remarkable,
            confounding speed.

            That was the tradition, the way things were passed down over and
            over again, one generation to the next. Beautifully woven and sewn
            neck-ties were soft to the touch and sturdy at the neck. Tough
            overcoats heavy and more handsome with each winter passed. Trousers
            with patterns of maze-like subtlety enhanced with his human touch:
            years of practice turned passion turned mastery.

            His Master's coveted and celebrated craft was born from a pot of
            esoteric cultures. Families of industrialists and aristocracies all
            over the world would see to it to share with him ideas on pleasures
            of custom elegance. Interestingly, it was the globe-trotting
            clientele who brought new designs and fresh ideas, which then his
            Master realized into physical form. It was this relationship with
            customers, which helped in the discovery of new techniques and paved
            the way for the craft to grow.

            Now, the apprentice takes his seat at the workshop, grown and with
            years under his belt. He remembers, with a sense of irony, his
            mentor would say - "The man is nothing, the work everything!"
